# HA Frameo Control Integration 🏠

This is a custom integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to control [Frameo](https://frameo.net/) digital photo frames.

This integration provides Home Assistant entities (`light`, `button`) for controlling your device. It was developed based on a **10.1" Frameo device running Android 6.0.1** and has been used with both the standard Frameo application and the alternative [ImmichFrame](https://github.com/ImmichFrame/immich-frame) client.

> [!WARNING]
> **Disclaimer:** This is a very early and highly experimental version. If you follow the setup steps in the correct order, it should work. However, long-term stability and behavior across Home Assistant restarts or network instabilities have not been thoroughly tested. Any contributions are very welcome!

## ‼️ Requirements

You **MUST** install and run the **[Frameo Control Backend Add-on](https://github.com/HunorLaczko/ha-frameo-control-addon)** before setting up this integration. The add-on is essential as it handles the direct USB/ADB communication with the device.

## 🚀 Installation

The recommended way to install is via the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS).

### HACS ✨ (Recommended)
1.  Ensure the **[Frameo Control Backend Add-on](https://github.com/HunorLaczko/ha-frameo-control-addon)** is installed and running first.
2.  Add this repository to HACS as a custom integration repository:
    * Click this button to add the repository to your Home Assistant instance:
      [![Add Repository to HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=HunorLaczko&repository=ha-frameo-control&category=integration)
    * Or, go to HACS > Integrations, click the three-dots menu (⋮), select "Custom repositories", and add the URL:
      ```
      [https://github.com/HunorLaczko/ha-frameo-control](https://github.com/HunorLaczko/ha-frameo-control)
      ```
3.  Install the `HA Frameo Control` integration from the HACS Integrations page.
4.  Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual Install ⌨️
1.  Download the `ha_frameo_control` directory from this repository's `main` branch.
2.  Copy the entire `ha_frameo_control` directory into the `<config>/custom_components/` directory of your Home Assistant installation.
3.  Restart Home Assistant.

## 🛠️ Configuration

With the Backend Add-on running, you can now add the integration.

1.  Navigate to **Settings > Devices & Services**.
2.  Click **Add Integration** and search for **"Frameo Control"**.
3.  **Configure Add-on Connection**: The first step shows the add-on host and port settings. If you're using default settings, just click **Submit**. Only change these if you modified the add-on configuration.
4.  **Select Connection Method**: Choose how to connect to your device.
    - **USB Cable (Recommended for setup)** - Use this for initial setup. Direct and reliable.
    - **Network (IP Address)** - Use this after enabling Wireless ADB (see below).
5.  **For USB connections**: Select your device from the discovered list and click **Submit**.
6.  **IMPORTANT: Check your device screen!** An **"Allow USB Debugging"** prompt will appear on the Frameo device. Tap **Allow** and make sure to check the **"Always allow from this computer"** checkbox. You have about two minutes to approve it.

The integration should now be set up and your entities will be created.

### ⚙️ Integration Options

After setup, you can configure additional options by clicking **Configure** on the integration:

- **Add-on Host/Port**: Change if you've reconfigured the backend add-on.
- **Screen Width/Height**: Override the auto-detected screen resolution. Useful if auto-detection fails.

## ✨ Switching to a Network Connection

The "Start Wireless ADB" button allows you to switch from a USB to a network connection. Please follow this specific workflow:

> [!NOTE]
> Once you enable wireless ADB, the USB ADB interface on the device will stop working until the device is rebooted. You will need to re-configure the integration.
> Consequently, if you reboot the device you have to enable wireless mode again. But this time it should remember HA's key and not ask for confirmation, so you should be able to connect. Enabling the wireless mode can be done in theory by a third device as well once the initial USB setup is done and you have ticked the always allow option in the ADB popup. 

> [!TIP]
> **Persistent Wireless ADB Workaround**
> 
> If wireless ADB keeps resetting after reboots (common on older Android versions), there's a workaround available. See [this Home Assistant community post](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/frameo-photo-frame/614527/13?u=hunorlaczko) or [this Github issue](https://github.com/HunorLaczko/ha-frameo-control/issues/3) for details. You can use the HA service described below to run the command (without the adb shell part).
> 
> **Tip:** Set a static IP address from the device itself to make reconnection more reliable.

1.  Ensure your integration is set up and working via **USB**.
2.  Press the **Start Wireless ADB** button in Home Assistant.
3.  On your Frameo device, go to its settings to find its IP Address. Or check your router.
4.  In Home Assistant, go to **Settings > Devices & Services**, find your Frameo Control integration, and **DELETE** it.
5.  Click **Add Integration** again and add **"Frameo Control"**.
6.  Click **Submit** on the add-on connection step (or configure if needed).
7.  This time, choose the **Network** connection method and enter the IP address of your device.

## 🔧 Services

The integration provides a custom service for advanced users.

### `ha_frameo_control.run_adb_command`

Execute a custom ADB shell command on the Frameo device. This is useful for advanced automation or debugging.

**Service Data:**

| Field     | Type   | Required | Description                                      |
| :-------- | :----- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `command` | string | Yes      | The ADB shell command to execute on the device.  |

**Example:**

```yaml
service: ha_frameo_control.run_adb_command
data:
  command: "input keyevent 26"  # Toggle power/screen
```

**Output:**

The service returns the command output and also fires an event `ha_frameo_control_adb_response` with the result, which you can use in automations.

```yaml
# Example automation listening for ADB response
automation:
  - alias: "Log ADB Command Result"
    trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: ha_frameo_control_adb_response
    action:
      - service: notify.persistent_notification
        data:
          title: "ADB Command Result"
          message: "{{ trigger.event.data.result }}"
```

**Common ADB Commands:**

| Command                                    | Description                          |
| :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `input keyevent 26`                        | Toggle screen on/off                 |
| `input keyevent 3`                         | Home button                          |
| `input keyevent 4`                         | Back button                          |
| `input tap X Y`                            | Tap at coordinates                   |
| `input swipe X1 Y1 X2 Y2`                  | Swipe gesture                        |
| `am start -n com.package/.Activity`        | Launch an app                        |

| `wm size`                                  | Get window manager size              |

## 🖼️ Entities

This integration creates a device with several entities to control your frame.

| Entity Type | Name                    | Description                                                                  |
| :---------- | :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `light`     | Screen                  | Controls the screen on/off state. Brightness control is available **only on rooted devices** (see below); non-rooted devices get on/off control only. |
| `button`    | Frameo Next Photo       | Uses a **swipe** gesture to advance to the next photo in the official Frameo app. |
| `button`    | Frameo Previous Photo   | Uses a **swipe** gesture to go to the previous photo in the official Frameo app.|
| `button`    | Immich Next Photo       | Uses a **tap** on the right side of the screen, optimized for the ImmichFrame app. |
| `button`    | Immich Previous Photo   | Uses a **tap** on the left side of the screen, optimized for the ImmichFrame app.  |
| `button`    | Immich Pause Photo      | Uses a **tap** in the center of the screen to toggle the OSD / pause.          |
| `button`    | Start Frameo App        | Launches the default Frameo application.                                     |
| `button`    | Start ImmichFrame       | Launches the ImmichFrame application.                                        |
| `button`    | Open Settings           | Opens the main Android Settings page on the device.                          |
| `button`    | Start Wireless ADB      | Enables Wireless ADB mode (see workflow above).                              |

## ⚡ On-Demand State Updates (No Polling)

This integration does **not** automatically poll the device. State is only fetched when you interact with it (buttons, light control, etc.).

**Why?** Frequent ADB commands over USB can destabilize the connection and cause `LIBUSB_ERROR_NO_DEVICE` errors. This approach also conserves resources and enables automatic reconnection on demand.

**Trade-offs:**
- State displayed in Home Assistant may become stale if the device is controlled manually or its screen times out.
- Screen resolution is automatically refreshed before gesture commands to handle orientation changes.

**Forcing a refresh:** Toggle the screen entity or press any button. To sync state in automation without affecting the device, call the `run_adb_command` service with `echo ok`.

## 🚧 Future Development (TODO)

This integration is still under development. Contributions and ideas are welcome!
* **Dynamic Controls:** Intelligently detect the currently open app (Frameo vs. Immich) to dynamically show only the relevant buttons.
* **Backend Improvements:** Investigate removing the need for `host_network: true` in the backend addon for improved network security.
* **Control Multiple Devices:** Allow a single Home Assistant instance to control more than one Frameo frame.

## 💡 Brightness Control (Rooted Devices Only)

The standard Android `settings put system screen_brightness` command has no effect on Frameo panels, which is why brightness control did not work in earlier versions. The only reliable way found so far is writing directly to the kernel's backlight sysfs node (e.g. `/sys/class/backlight/rk28_bl/brightness`), which requires root.

On every `/connect`, the addon:
1. Checks for root via `su -c id`.
2. Looks for a backlight device under `/sys/class/backlight/`.

If both succeed, the `light` entity exposes full brightness control (scaled to the device's native backlight range). If either check fails, the entity falls back to **on/off only** - there is no partial or best-effort brightness support, since a non-rooted device has no known working method to change it.

This means:
* Non-rooted devices: unaffected, on/off control as before.
* Rooted devices: brightness control now works, detected automatically - no configuration needed.

## Known Issues

* The connection to the device can sometimes be lost if the addon or Home Assistant restarts. If entities become `Unavailable`, reloading the integration from the Devices & Services page will usually fix it.
* There is a significant delay (few seconds even) when interacting from HA (next image, pause, screen, etc.). This was a compromise I had to make to have a reliable connection. 
* On some devices turning off the screen results in the device sleeping (presumably). This means that the entities become `Unavailable` right after turning off the screen. In this case you manually have to turn it back on and reload the integration. I don't have a workaround for this yet.
